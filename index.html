								<h2>Personal Information</h2>
							</header>
							<p>My name is Nguyen Vinh Quang. I am 20 years old. My id number is s3817788 and email is nguyenvinhquang2362@gmail.com for personal contact and s3817788@rmit.edu.vn for studying. I am from Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. My day of birth is 23th June. This is my profile about me and the world of IT in my perspective. <br/><br/>Firstly, I am also called Edward which is the name of a Britain's king. One of my English teachers gave it to me. I told him my name means “glory” so he said using a king’s name could be a great choice. Surprisingly, king Edward VIII has same day of birth as me so I took it. Although I know his path is not that glory. <br/><br/>Secondly, I am a perfectionist. If I do something, it needs to be balanced or in 90 to 100% at least with me. However, I am also lazy and that helps me to control myself from being too strict in doing things. Overall, I am actually open-minded, I always consider everything on two sides before making a decision. I also hate to apply my thought to others and vice versa. I know nothing is perfect. <br/><br/> Finally, I love playing sports and games with my friend. I play it whenever I am free or stressed. It makes me feel refreshed and forget loneliness. We are used to spending our weekend doing it because most of us are studying or working. Despite spending most of the time with people, sometimes, I like to chill out alone. At this time, I usually watch anime or reading mangas and science book. It has taught me a lot of things. <br/><br/>That is some background information about me. For other parts below are my journey to IT. </p>

								<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							</header>
							<h3><strong>Paths I want to take</strong></h3>
							<p> In the IT world, there are two fields I feel interested in which are the AI and the UX/UI:
							<br/>
							<br/>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/AI.jpg" alt="" height="200" /></span>First of all, the artificial intelligence (AI) is a new area in the world of technology and it is developing unduly fast. In my opinion, Vietnam is still poor in this field so it needs our young, energetic spirit and creative mind to help it evolve and catch up with the world. Moreover, I find excitement in creating a virtual mind that can interact like humans. In the world, there has already been Sophia which is the first robot to receive citizenship. However, the movement still looks inflexible. The thought of Vietnam achieving such invention always gives me goosebumps.
							<br/>
							<br/>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/UX-UI.jpg" alt="" height="200" /></span>Secondly, the user experience design and user-interact are also attractive to me. When IT is full of codes and numbers, the UX/UI seems to be more delightful and colorful. Its goal is to please the customers by art and movement in technologies. In my point of view, some interacts of applications in smartphones and operating systems need to be smoother and friendlier to approach. For example, in the Android platform, some default functions are very hard to use or find. Because of that, it gives me the ambition to develop it.
								</p>
							<h3><strong>The spark of the excitement</strong></h3>
							<p>I have started to read and research about IT since middle school. However, both of my interests came quite late. I got excited about AI when I make a presentation about the ASIMO robot. I think about UX/UI when I change my third phone. At that time, I think about if I were a phone developer, what would I do to make my phone fancier but not complicated. Although I have yet to made a final decision about which fields I will choose yet, I hope it will come as soon as possible. </p>
							<h3><strong>Why did I choose RMIT?</strong></h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/RMIT.jpg" alt="" height="300" /></span>At first, I was aiming to apply to the Vietnam National University of Information Technology. I was very happy after I had made it to my dream university. Then, my family thinks that I should choose RMIT to study because it has an international environment and one of my siblings has already studied there. It was a hard time for me to think when I had only three weeks to make the final decision. I came to meet my sibling who had graduated RMIT to ask for advice. I used to scare that I would be isolated by classmates because they are rich. She immediately changed my perspective when she told me about how fun the time was when she was studying at RMIT. Thanks to her story, I can feel free to make my step with no hesitation. Although I had not prepaired for studying at RMIT, my English was at a low level. I still had had great times at the English course, before I made it to my major.</p>
							<h3><strong>Experience is first priority</strong></h3>
							<p>In the beginning, I know that RMIT can change major so I have spent two first weeks in semester 3 – 2019 studying Design. I want to experience it in order to make sure I will not regret my choice in the future. At present, I feel that this is the major I belong to. During the course, I expect to decide on the field that I will go to and also improve knowledge about IT. Furthermore, I want to have new friends. RMIT students are very talented so it is an advantage to try to expand my relationships.</p>

							<p>According to <a href="https://itviec.com/it-jobs/02-ai-dl-python-engineer-600-1500-eastgate-software-1104?lab_feature=employer_job">the advertisement</a>, the company is finding a software engineer which relate to AI and deep learning (DL) by using Python and database. They are finding members for a new and growing team for developing machine learning applications to improve some service systems. They are aiming for the convenience of technology in near future. They are researching in AI which is a field that I am interested in. Moreover, they have the same purpose as me is made our life easier with machines
							</br>
							</br>
							<ul>
								The requirements for this job are not too strict. They ask for:
								<li>A Bachelor’s degree of Information Technology.</li>
								<li>Enthusiasm for Big Data and Data Science.</li>
								<li>One year of experience in Python and some other areas.</li>
								<li>Knowledge and experience in machine learning and analytics algorithms in classification.</li>
								<li>Being an active and effective teammate.</li>

							</ul>
							<ul>
								At the moment, I have met some requirements:
								<li>Being an active and effective teammate.</li>
								<li>Already had English skills.</li>
							</ul>
								Overall, I have had 2 in 6 requirements by now. In the RMIT IT program structure, it has Machine learning and Analytics Algorithms subject so I will learn them soon. I just need to get close with Database to understand and try to find its interesting aspect. For other programming languages, I have to learn it by myself if they are not taught at university.

								<div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-50">
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/3test.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>

								<h3><strong>These tests are important with me</strong></h3>
									<p>The accuracy of these tests would be 90 – 100%, if we took it seriously and honestly. Because of that, it is really reliable for me to identify my characteristics. Especially, the Myers-Briggs test of 16personalities website has amazed me when I see the result. It gave me the feeling that I am reading a webpage that describe myself. My strengths and weaknesses are pointed out clearly. To sum up, three results help me understand what aspects of life that I am good at so I can be confident to participate in. As well as my weaknesses to avoid or improve it.</p>
								<h3><strong>But I am not going to apply on you</strong></h3>
									<p>Based on result from these tests, I can use it as a tool to find my teammates. However, I am not going to judge people by it. To be more specific, I will use their Myers-Briggs test to look into their personality so that I can know are they an extravert or introvert and also their strengths and weaknesses. Then, I will meet people that I think I can collaborate with in class to know more about them and do they the same or difference with their results. I do not mind about their learning type because different people have different types to study. Overall, I use their results to reduce the number of classmates that I need to contact. I prefer to evaluate collaborators by myself.</p>
								<h3><strong>It is a tool for me</strong></h3>
									<p>In a team, I am looking forward to forming it in balance. My group must have both types of mind because if a group full of extravert or introvert, it will be hard to generate. For example, a group of 4 introverts will find difficulty in sharing their ideas. Moreover, all teammates must support each other. Base on the results, we have already known our strengths and weaknesses so in a team, everyone must engage or help other downsides. For instance, the presenter might be weak at researching so a person in that group must good or at least have skill to find information. </p>

									<h2>Project ideas</h2>
								</header>
								<div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-50">
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/PJ.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
										<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
								<p>My project will relate to both fields that I interest in. It is called S.A.M which means Smart Android Manager. SAM is a virtual assistant and integrated into an Android phone just like SIRI of IOS. Plus, it can control the IoT network in our home. SAM will learn from user habits to make their daily life easier in many ways. To give customers the best experience, the AI will design itself to be suitable. For example, it can change names, genders, languages and accents. SAM will make the user feel like they have a real partner.</p>
										<h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>
								<p>There are two reasons that inspire me to make this project. The first one is updating the Google Assistance and second is helping users to manage their daily life. The Google Assistance or even other AIs can only follow user requests then execute that order. That makes it become very passive. What I want is the assistance can learn and adapt to their customer’s habits. Moreover, it should be active when the user shouts its name out, not by button. For example, I normally travel to school in one way. On a random day, there is an accident or that stress is constructed, it will update for me to take other routes. For the second reason, people are becoming busier day by day. It is very lucky for someone can manage or remain them to do. Due to many appointments one may have, a person may make two appointments which occur simultaneously or forget it. I want to create an AI that can access insight other applications and convert every date that the user has made to its cloud. In addition, an idea is that make an active AI for customers.</p>
										<h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
								<p>As I described in the Overview, SAM will be integrated on our Android devices and also control the house’s IoT network. It will store user information and other materials, such as timetables and appointments in Google Cloud which use Google account to identify. Some customers need more security like, business. There will be a payable pack for private Cloud where only Google and that agency can access. For the first contact with a new user, it will ask for types of accents and genders that the owner prefers. Then, when SAM has been generated, it will execute some deeper functions to help the user as a real manager:
								</br>
								</br>
								<strong>Learn to help:</strong><span class="image left"><img src="images/help.jpg" alt="" /></span> In the modern world, 24 hours are usually too short to finish everything in perfect condition. People try to make it fast then heading home or hanging out. Frequently, some bad habits will occur. For instance, programmers and designers are normally working at night so they do not have much time to sleep. They usually have a problem waking early and getting late for events. SAM will deal with this problem in steps by steps. Firstly, it will have a right to access to all communicated applications such as Gmail, phone and message. Then, when you make a call or send a mail that relates to make a date in the morning. Finally, it will considerate that the user will have enough sleep for the night before by making a remind on voice at that night. If the owner is need to work late, SAM will immediately remind after finish a mail or a call.
								</br>
								</br>
								<strong>Learn to serve:</strong><span class="image left"><img src="images/IOT.jpg" alt="" /></span> -	Ready to serve: SAM holds user’s schedules of a day. It will use the IoT network to make all machines work automatically. For example, the owner usually heads home at 6 pm, the AC will be activated at 5:45 pm. Moreover, based on the environment, the temperature will be calculatedly altered. For instance, in Summer, AC will be used and heater will be operated in Winter. The light will be adjusted to be appropriate with the activities of the owner. To illustrate it, at the time from 9 pm to 1 am, the user is working so the light will always at the brightest level.
								</p>
								<p>
								With the AI system, SAM can do even more. However, these are the two main functions make SAM different, turn it to a project that can bring the best experience to clients.
								</p>
										<h3><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong></h3>
								<p>For the brain of SAM, the Google Cloud AI Platform will be very suitable for developing. I am aiming to update the AI of Google so using their platform might notice my project. Firstly, the required software. Based on DevTeam.Space, when using Google Cloud AI Platform, we can easily approach machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, speech and vision. All of them are the basics of an AI must have. For the IoT network, it needs to be secured at high level. Using some identity services engines, firewall and software defined like Cisco to take control the network. Secondly, the required hardware. The AI accelerator is a microprocessor and it is also a brain of the IoT network. The IoT network need route of Internet throughout electronic devices like AC and light bulbs. Therefore, a wireless modem is necessary.</p>
										<h3><strong>Skills Required</strong></h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/python.jpg" alt="" /></span>With this project, I need to have experience in Big Data, Machine learning, deep learning and algorithms/analysts. Coding skill in Python needed to be proficient or other areas, such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Machine Learning Fundamentals. Intermediate knowledge about computer system like circuit installation and assembling.</p>
										<h3><strong>Outcome</strong></h3>
								<p>For this project, it just an idea of a person who have just started learning about IT. Because of that, I cannot measure how much it cost. However, if this project came true, I would like to sale it at the price that everyone can afford. By that, many people life would be better. They can arrange their time more logically. The user will no longer need to worry about forgetting things that they would normally do. In conclusion, with virtual manager named SAM, user’s issues will never be a burden anymore.</p>
